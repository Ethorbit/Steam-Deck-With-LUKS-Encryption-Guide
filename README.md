## No longer maintained
I've switched to [Jovian-NixOS](https://github.com/Jovian-Experiments/Jovian-NixOS), a [NixOS](https://nixos.org/)-powered replica of SteamOS.
You can find my system config along with a NixOS port of my Steam Decrypt Script here: https://github.com/Ethorbit/nixos-configs/tree/master/steamdeck.

The reason I switched is because I don't like maintaining unpredictable systems. With NixOS, you get a declarative, reproducible system, and it delivers the reliability that a Steam Deck needs, because the last thing you want is the OS changing the moment you want to play something.
